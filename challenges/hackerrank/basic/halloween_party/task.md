If the chocolate can be served as only 1 x 1 sized pieces and Alex can cut the chocolate bar exactly K times, what is the maximum number of chocolate pieces Alex can cut and give Silvia?

##Input Format
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow.
Each line contains an integer K.

##Output Format
T lines; each line should contain an integer that denotes the maximum number of pieces that can be obtained for each test case.

##Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
2 ≤ K ≤ 107

Note: Chocolate must be served in 1 x 1 sized pieces. Alex can't relocate any of the pieces, nor can he place any piece on top of another.
